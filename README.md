# GUI-Exercise3
a Java application that would act as the introduction to a game. There would be a starting screen with options (buttons) for instructions, play and quit. The instructions button would open another window with some simple instructions (it should have a back button to go back to the home page). The play button would open another window that would be a game (you do NOT actually have to create this “game”, just add a picture or something creative that could represent a game), but don’t forget a back button to the main menu (starting screen). And, obviously, the quit button will close all the windows to exit the program.
